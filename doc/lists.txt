INTRODUCTION                                                      *lists-intro*

This is a Vim plugin to manage text based lists. The plugin is inactive by
default. It can be activated for a specific buffer with |:ListsEnable|. One
can also specify to auto enable for specific filetypes with
|g:lists_filetypes|.

The functionality was earlier a part of |wiki.vim| [0] and implemented for my
personal convenience. However, as someone pointed out [1], these features do
not really have anything to do with the wiki functionality of |wiki.vim|. It
is now therefore a separate plugin.

LIST TYPES                                                        *lists-types*

|lists.vim| is quite minimal and does not have a lot of available
configuration choices. The implementation is based on the idea that list items
are indented consistently. The indentation makes it easy to parse a list to
determine its structure.

These types of lists are currently supported:
* Bullet lists. Bullets are either "*" or "-".
* Numbered lists formated similar to "1.".
* List items can be decorated with check boxes. Examples:
  * [x] checked
  * [ ] unchecked
* List items can be decorated with labels like "TODO:" and "DONE:".

==============================================================================
FEATURES                                                       *lists-features*

The following is a list of the commands and mappings provided by |lists.vim|.

*:ListsEnable*
  Load |lists.vim| for the current buffer.

  Note: This is the only global command. If |lists.vim| is not loaded, none of
        the other features are available.

*:ListsToggle*
*<plug>(lists-toggle)*
  Toggle a list items "status". For checkboxes, this means to toggle the
  checkmark on/off. Elsewhere, we toggle between statuses defined in
  |g:lists_todos|. This mapping exists in both normal and insert mode.

*:ListsToggleCheckbox*
*<plug>(lists-toggle-checkbox)*
  Toggle a checklist item. If the current item does not have a checkbox, it
  will be added. This mapping exists in both normal and insert mode.

*i_<plug>(lists-new-element)*
  An insert mode mapping to add a new element in the current list. This is
  useful after creating a new line below a list element to add the
  bullet/dash/number in front, possibly with a checkbox if relevant.

*:ListsToggleBullet*
*<plug>(lists-bullet-toggle-all)*
  Toggle the list bullet type between `-` and `*`. for the entire list.

*:ListsToggleBullet!*
*<plug>(lists-bullet-toggle-local)*
  Toggle the list bullet type between `-` and `*` for the sibling list
  entries.

*:ListsMoveUp*
*:ListsMoveDown*
*<plug>(lists-moveup)*
*<plug>(lists-movedown)*
  Move current list item up/down through a list.

*:ListsUniq*
*<plug>(lists-uniq)*
  Parse the current list and remove repeated entries recursively.

*:ListsUniqLocal*
*<plug>(lists-uniq-local)*
  Similar to |:ListsUniq|, but only within the current list depth.

*<plug>(lists-al)*
*<plug>(lists-il)*
  Text object for list items. The inner object is the current list item
  including children, the outer object is the parent list item including all
  its children.
  The following mappings are available as visual mode and operator mode
  mappings, i.e. |xmap| and |omap|.

                                                          *lists-maps-defaults*
The default mappings are listed in the following table. To disable the default
mappings, see |g:lists_maps_default_enable|. They can also be overrided
individually with |g:lists_maps_default_override|. The map mode is indicated
by the first letters of the various map commands (|nmap|, |imap|, |omap|, and
|xmap|).

   PLUG                                DEFAULT         MODE~
   ----                                -------         ----~
   |<plug>(lists-toggle)|                <c-s>           `in`
   |<plug>(lists-toggle-checkbox)|       NONE            `in`
   |i_<plug>(lists-new-element)|         <c-a>           `i`
   |<plug>(lists-moveup)|                <leader>wlk     `n`
   |<plug>(lists-movedown)|              <leader>wlj     `n`
   |<plug>(lists-uniq)|                  <leader>wlu     `n`
   |<plug>(lists-uniq-local)|            <leader>wlU     `n`
   |<plug>(lists-bullet-toggle-local)|   <leader>wlT     `n`
   |<plug>(lists-bullet-toggle-all)|     <leader>wlt     `n`
   |<plug>(lists-al)|                    al              `ox`
   |<plug>(lists-il)|                    il              `ox`

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                                    *lists-config*

*g:lists_filetypes*
  List of filetypes for which |lists.vim| should be enabled.

  Default: []

*g:lists_maps_default_enable*
  Set to |v:false| or 0 to prevent |lists.vim| from applying the default maps.
  Useful if you want to create your own mappings.

  Default: |v:true|

*g:lists_maps_default_override*
  A dictionary that allows to override one or more of the default mappings.
  The dictionary keys should be one of the available mappings, possibly with
  mode indicator. The value should be the desired map target. The available
  mappings with default values are listed in |lists-maps-defaults|.

  To disable a map, one can link it to an empty string.

  For example, to remap the insert-mode mapping |<plug>(lists-new-element)| to
  `<c-t>` and the normal mode variant of |<plug>(lists-toggle)| to `<c-y>`, as
  well as disabling the insert mode variant of the latter, one could do this: >

    let g:lists_maps_default_override = {
          \ 'i_<plug>(lists-new-element)': '<c-t>',
          \ 'i_<plug>(lists-toggle)': '',
          \ '<plug>(lists-toggle)': '<c-y>',
          \}
<
  Default: `{}`

*g:lists_todos*
  A list of TODO toggles that may be toggled with |<plug>(lists-toggle)|, which
  is by default mapped to `<c-s>`.

  Default: `['TODO', 'DONE']`
